## Build

### Prerequisites

- **TeX Live 2024+** or **MiKTeX** (full installation)
- **Python 3** with [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) installed (`pip install Pygments`) — required by the `minted` package for code highlighting
- **Biber** — for bibliography processing
- Chinese edition requires **XeLaTeX** (recommended) or LuaLaTeX

### Compilation

**English edition (pdfLaTeX):**
```bash
cd english
make pdf
```

**Chinese edition (XeLaTeX):**
```bash
cd chinese
make pdf
```

The Makefile includes the `-shell-escape` flag required by `minted`.

### Clean up

```bash
make clean       # Remove auxiliary files
make cleanall    # Remove auxiliary files + PDF
```
